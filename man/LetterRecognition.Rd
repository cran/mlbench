\description{
   The objective is to identify each of a large number of black-and-white
   rectangular pixel displays as one of the 26 capital letters in the English
   alphabet.  The character images were based on 20 different fonts and each
   letter within these 20 fonts was randomly distorted to produce a file of
   20,000 unique stimuli.  Each stimulus was converted into 16 primitive
   numerical attributes (statistical moments and edge counts) which were then
   scaled to fit into a range of integer values from 0 through 15.  We
   typically train on the first 16000 items and then use the resulting model
   to predict the letter category for the remaining 4000.  See the article
   cited below for more details.

    "Letter Recognition Using Holland-style Adaptive Classifiers".

    The research for this article investigated the ability of several
    variations of Holland-style adaptive classifier systems to learn to
    correctly guess the letter categories associated with vectors of 16
    integer attributes extracted from raster scan images of the letters.
    The best accuracy obtained was a little over 80\%.  It would be
    interesting to see how well other methods do with the same data.
