This package contains a collection of real-world datasets and
functions for creating artificial datasets that work as benchmarks for
machine learning methods.

Most datasets have been taken from the UCI Repository of Machine
Learning Databases.  See the corresponding help files for original data
sources.

Some conversions are done for smoother usage in R (like conversions to
factors), all changes are recorded in file Data-Administration.R.
