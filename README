This package contains a collection of real-world datasets and
functions for creating artificial datasets that work as benchmarks for
machine learning methods.

Most datasets have been taken from the UCI repository at
    ftp://ftp.ics.uci.edu/pub/machine-learning-databases
    http://www.ics.uci.edu/~mlearn/MLRepository.html
See the corresponding help files for original data sources. 

Some conversions are done for smoother usage in R (like conversions to
factors), all changes are recorded in file Data-Administration.R.
