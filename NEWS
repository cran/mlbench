Changes in Version 1.0-1

  o Fixed a Bug in the waveform function (thanks to Karsten Lübke).

  o Added a "ZipData: No" to the DESCRIPTION file.

  o All data files are now in compressed format.
  

Changes in Version 1.0-0

  o New function mlbench.smiley().

  o Version 1.0-0 is not really different from the previous release
    (version 0.5-10), but we decided that it is stupid to have a
    version number smaller than 1.0 for a package that is stable and
    useful.
